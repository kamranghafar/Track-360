                      DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Use this checklist when deploying to a new system:

PRE-DEPLOYMENT:
---------------
[ ] Verify Python 3.8+ is installed on target system
    Command: python --version (Windows) or python3 --version (Linux/Mac)

[ ] Ensure you have copied the ENTIRE folder to the target system
    - All files and subdirectories
    - Especially db.sqlite3 (contains all data)

[ ] Check available disk space (minimum 500MB)

[ ] Note your network IP address if allowing network access
    Windows: ipconfig
    Linux/Mac: ip addr or ifconfig


FIRST-TIME SETUP ON NEW SYSTEM:
--------------------------------
[ ] Navigate to the Portable-Dashboard-Deploy folder

[ ] Run the setup script:
    Windows: Double-click setup.bat OR run: python setup.py
    Linux/Mac: Run: bash setup.sh OR run: python3 setup.py

[ ] Setup script should complete these tasks:
    [ ] Check Python version
    [ ] Offer to create virtual environment (recommended: YES)
    [ ] Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
    [ ] Check/create database
    [ ] Offer to create admin user (recommended: YES if new database)

[ ] Verify setup completed without errors


STARTING THE DASHBOARD:
-----------------------
[ ] Run the startup script:
    Windows: Double-click start_dashboard.bat OR run: python start_dashboard.py
    Linux/Mac: Run: bash start_dashboard.sh OR run: python3 start_dashboard.py

[ ] When prompted for IP address:
    - For local access only: Enter 127.0.0.1 or localhost
    - For network access: Enter 0.0.0.0 (recommended)
    - Or press ENTER for default (0.0.0.0)

[ ] When prompted for port:
    - Enter desired port (e.g., 8000, 8080, 3000)
    - Or press ENTER for default (8000)
    - Note: Choose different port if default is in use

[ ] Verify server starts without errors


POST-STARTUP VERIFICATION:
--------------------------
[ ] Open web browser

[ ] Navigate to the dashboard URL:
    Local: http://127.0.0.1:PORT
    Network: http://YOUR_IP:PORT

[ ] Verify dashboard loads correctly

[ ] Test login functionality

[ ] Check that data is present (if migrating existing database)

[ ] Verify all features work as expected:
    [ ] Dashboard home page
    [ ] Project listings
    [ ] Resource management
    [ ] KPI tracking
    [ ] AI chat assistant (if configured)


NETWORK ACCESS (if needed):
---------------------------
[ ] Confirm firewall allows traffic on chosen port

[ ] Share the network URL with users:
    Format: http://YOUR_IP:PORT
    Example: http://192.168.1.100:8000

[ ] Test access from another device on the network

[ ] Ensure network stability for continuous operation


TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST:
--------------------------
If setup fails:
[ ] Check Python version is 3.8 or higher
[ ] Verify internet connection (needed for downloading packages)
[ ] Try manual installation: pip install -r requirements.txt
[ ] Check for permission issues (especially on Linux/Mac)
[ ] Review error messages in terminal/console

If startup fails:
[ ] Check if port is already in use (choose different port)
[ ] Verify database file exists (db.sqlite3)
[ ] Check file permissions
[ ] Try running with verbose output: python manage.py runserver

If dashboard doesn't load:
[ ] Verify correct URL (check IP and port)
[ ] Check firewall settings
[ ] Try accessing from local machine first (http://127.0.0.1:PORT)
[ ] Check browser console for errors
[ ] Verify server is still running


PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------
For production deployments, consider:
[ ] Generate new SECRET_KEY in settings.py
[ ] Set DEBUG = False in settings.py
[ ] Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS
[ ] Set up HTTPS/SSL
[ ] Use a production-grade server (gunicorn, uwsgi)
[ ] Set up proper backup system for database
[ ] Configure logging
[ ] Set up monitoring


BACKUP RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------
[ ] Create backup of db.sqlite3 before making changes
[ ] Store backups in a secure location
[ ] Test backup restoration procedure
[ ] Schedule regular automated backups
[ ] Document backup/restore process


MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST:
----------------------
[ ] Keep Python and dependencies updated
[ ] Monitor disk space (database grows over time)
[ ] Review logs for errors or issues
[ ] Test backup and restore procedures periodically
[ ] Document any customizations or changes
