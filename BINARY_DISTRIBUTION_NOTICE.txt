                      BINARY DISTRIBUTION NOTICE
================================================================================

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
-----------------------------------------

This is a BINARY/COMPILED distribution of the Dashboard application.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
----------------
✓ Application runs normally with full functionality
✓ Source code (.py files) has been compiled to bytecode (.pyc files)
✓ Source code is NOT included and NOT visible
✓ Application logic is protected from casual inspection
✓ You CANNOT edit or modify the application code
✓ This is a PLUG-AND-PLAY package - just run it!


WHAT IS INCLUDED:
-----------------
✓ Compiled Python bytecode (.pyc files) - Application logic
✓ Database (db.sqlite3) - All your data
✓ Templates (HTML files) - User interface layouts
✓ Static files (CSS, JS, images) - Styling and assets
✓ Configuration files - Settings and requirements
✓ Startup scripts - Easy launch scripts
✓ Documentation - User guides and instructions


WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED:
---------------------
✗ Python source code (.py files) - Removed for IP protection
✗ Application logic source - Compiled to bytecode
✗ Internal implementation details - Protected


WHY BINARY DISTRIBUTION?
-------------------------
1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
   - Protects proprietary business logic
   - Prevents unauthorized code modifications
   - Maintains code confidentiality

2. PLUG-AND-PLAY SIMPLICITY
   - Users don't need to understand code
   - Reduced complexity for end users
   - Focus on functionality, not implementation

3. SECURITY
   - Prevents tampering with application logic
   - Reduces risk of unauthorized modifications
   - Protects sensitive algorithms and processes


HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
Python can execute compiled bytecode (.pyc files) directly without source code.

When you run the startup script:
1. Python loads the compiled bytecode files
2. Executes them just like regular Python code
3. Dashboard runs normally with full functionality
4. No difference in performance or features


CAN YOU DECOMPILE IT?
----------------------
Technically, Python bytecode CAN be decompiled back to approximate source code.
However:
- Decompilation is legally questionable and may violate licensing terms
- Decompiled code loses comments, formatting, and some structure
- This distribution provides basic protection for standard use cases

For enterprise-level code protection (encryption, obfuscation, etc.), contact
the vendor for professional solutions.


WHAT YOU CAN DO:
----------------
✓ Run the application normally
✓ Use all features and functionality
✓ Access and modify the database (your data)
✓ Customize templates (HTML appearance)
✓ Customize static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
✓ Deploy to multiple systems
✓ Back up and restore your data


WHAT YOU CANNOT DO:
-------------------
✗ View or edit the application logic (compiled bytecode)
✗ Modify business rules or workflows (protected code)
✗ Access internal implementation details
✗ Reverse engineer the application (may violate license)
✗ Redistribute the compiled code (check license terms)
